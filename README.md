**Vigenere Cipher Encrypter/Decrypter**

This screen allows users to enter plaintext in the left field and a list of keywords. 
These can then be used to encode the data using the Encode button and output the ciphertext in the right field.

Vice versa, cipher text can be entered in the left field and the list of keywords. The Decode button will return the plain text in the right field.

There are options to Load data from a file and save the output to a file. 
There is a Ciphertext Format checkbox which formats the ciphertext into columns of 5 characters and pads the laft column with X's to make it up to 5.
The Cipher Strength indicator calculates the lowest common multiple of the lengths of the entered keywords and compares this to the length of the plaintext.
